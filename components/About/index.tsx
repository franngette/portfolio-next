      <p>
        I live and work in Mar del Plata, Argentina. I have passion in code tools to help people and solve problems.
        <br />
        My main area of interest are building functional and interactive interfaces using React, React Native and Atomic
        Design.
        <br />
        Every project has something to learn and I'm always interested in learn new stuff.
